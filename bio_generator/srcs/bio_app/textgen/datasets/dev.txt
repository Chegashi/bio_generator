javascript / node js /  react js / redux / mongodb / git ,learning to write programs stretches your mind, and helps you think better, creates a way of thinking about things that i think is helpful in all domains.       bill gates, co-chairman, bill & melinda gates foundation, co-founder, microsoft  i couldn't agree more. learning to write programs is the equivalent of giving the mind a paintbrush that creates in infinite dimensions. at the end of the day, what we're doing in programming is solving problems.   that's why i do it. that's why i have been drawn to programming - i want to have the tools (mental and technical) available to solve problems in an effective, and efficient way that also engages my senses. i want to problem-solve with creativity and logic. i want to create with 1's and 0's.  i see development as a human-centered endeavor via the use of human-created machines.   or, to quote the great michael scott,      people will never be replaced by machines. in the end, life and business are about human connections. and computers are about trying to murder you in a lake. and to me the choice is easy.   - michael scott, the office   (season 4, episode 3)  i have a board of directors in the form of digital and live mentors. i access them through podcasts, books, youtube, and in person. here are a few of the principles i glean from my mentors and things i do my best to emulate every day.   - stand up straight and put your chaos into order.  - do hard things. you'll be grateful for the struggle.  - be kind to everyone. life is too short to be otherwise.   - maintain a growth mindset and stay curious. ( a la richard feynman)  - be engaged in a career field where helping others and providing value is paramount.   - most fear is in our heads. real-life is never as scary as what goes on in our minds.   - everything is data. do not get emotionally attached to data or allow emotion and bias to override data-driven decisions.  - fail fast, fail often

i have never found myself being a fan of mediocrity and i tried to develop the habit of facing and overcoming challenges to learn more and to achieve more!  i love computer science and engineering. that is why i studied software engineering as an undergraduate student.  later, i found myself gravitated toward the world of data mining. this quotation stuck with me   we're drowning in data, but starving for knowledge!  i applied and got admitted to the best university of my home country to study data mining, machine learning, pattern recognition, etc. i broke out of my comfort zone and lots of great things have happened since then. i earned my master's degree in artificial intelligence and i ranked 1st among all computer engineering graduates.  as one of the novel and challenging applications of machine learning, i chose to study dna microarrays of cancer tumors in my ms thesis. this opened the door for me to the interdisciplinary world of bioinformatics. i applied to usc which has the oldest and one of the most reputable computational biology and bioinformatics programs in the united states. i was honored to win the usc provost's phd fellowship which is the most prestigious university-wide fellowship.  shortly, i found that statistics plays a very important role in this field and to better understand and apply data analysis and machine learning algorithms, i need to better know the underlying statistical concepts. i embraced this challenge and i earned a master   s degree in statistics in parallel with my phd studies on computational problems in metagenomics.  i believe i am a good team player and a quick learner. i have always developed myself to be hard-working, goal-oriented, self-motivated, and good at creative and critical thinking. now, i am so excited and passionate to use my extensive academic training to solve real-world problems in the industry and i enthusiastically believe the upcoming challenges help me grow further and bring more value to my career. , sap , president

i   ve spent most of my career in sales, i love it.  i love the visibility of sales, the constant need to evolve how you win, the days you can celebrate with your team and the ones where you need to put your arm round them and show its going to be ok.  it   s a tough environment to be in but its always made me feel so alive.   there's been a collision of things that demand us to reimagine the old sales machine and start building teams that are 'in it together'. our buyer is smarter, our employees needs have changed and there are layers to our sales team structures that require our people to rely on each other if we're going to suceed.    building the team that wins together is where i'm happiest and feel incredibly lucky to have the opportunity to be part of the jiminny team and help other leaders do just that. ,

software developer, problem solver, technology enthusiast  ,i've always had a love for all things analytical and logic-oriented. ever since the grade school logical problems of  grass is to green as sky is to ________ , i was hooked on solving puzzles of all forms. whether it be a crossword puzzle or a math homework problem, i couldn't get enough of having a problem and working my way towards the answer. after all, math problems are just puzzles with numbers and variables. this is what eventually lead me to pursuing a degree in mathematics.  in addition to math, i have found a love for programming, which i experienced for the first time while at university. despite the brutal introduction that so many people face when learning programming, i learned to absolutely love the process of banging my head against the keyboard and screen until i hit that magical moment when i run my code and it finally works the way i intended. because of this immense satisfaction that programming gives me, in addition to the opportunity to create, i enrolled at a full-time, full-stack web development bootcamp hosted by the university of denver. it has been the best decision of my life and every week i crave the knowledge that allows me to create powerful and beautiful web applications.  i hope to someday use my analytical, logical, programming, and interpersonal skills to be successful enough that i can make a significant difference in the world. whether i am building web applications that improve people's lives or supporting/volunteering with charities, my life mission is to use the gifts  i've been given to improve other's lives and i can die happy if i am able to create a brighter future for even a single person (but it will, of course, be millions by the time i'm done here).  thank you for taking the time to read this and have a great rest of your day! ,

please feel free to contact me for anything from asking a simple question, reviewing work, making a personal connection with someone i know, to even grabbing coffee and mentoring. i look forward to helping in any way that i can.  five things that make me good at what i do    1. no fear to fail - allows me to push boundaries without worrying about the risk. i build faster knowing that i can get to my failures faster and overcome / fix them quicker.  2. desire to change - most people love their comfort zone and hate to change. i desire things to constantly be evolving. granted this puts way more work on my plate, but it also pushes me to better myself everyday.  3. imagination - i embrace my childlike way of life. i love to have fun, whether it is playing video games, watching animated movies, or even day dreaming of other worlds. to push past what we know, we need to imagine things outside of the known. mixing things together that don't make sense is done by using your imagination. i tend to come up with my best ideas after i have been acting like a kid for a couple hours.  4. devil's advocate - most people love and hate me for this reason at the same time. i will practice this characteristic when i believe others are settling for something that can be better. i love asking questions to stir up answers that might not have come out if everyone agreed. i enjoy ripping ideas apart, to find why the person really is pursuing the idea. sometimes i find out that they just are in it for the money and they didn't actually think about solving a problem.  5. passionate - giving up is for those who don't have a reason to keep going. many people have succeeded against all odds, because of their passionate drive. i only work on what i am passionate about. lastly, i am very passionate about creation and new ideas. i love helping other brainstorm and strategize how to make their idea come to life and be successful. , joalbright ,

for over 20 years, i've built business solutions around technology. since 2000, i've watched the rate at which businesses adopt emerging technologies rise, which requires us as technology leaders to keep entire workforces connected. increased connectivity with customers and vendors must be supported by enhanced infrastructure including computers, mobile devices, cloud solutions, and media creation software.  over the years, i've learned and practiced the critical art of building bridges between technology and people. without people who are engaged with their hearts and minds in technology solutions, business sees little improvement. successful implementation of technology solutions requires deep collaboration and empathy. great business leaders listen to their people, understand their challenges, and find ways to improve technology. successful execution also requires communication and training, which requires an understanding of how the workforce thinks and learns, reasons for why the new solution exists, and a level of teaching mastery to effectively educate workers in the use of new technology.  these are the principles and philosophies i promote as a leader in technology-driven organizations. i have a strong reputation as a technical expert, but even more so as a leader of teams. i enjoy coaching and mentoring team members as much as i enjoy managing projects.   most recently, i was involved with a renewable energy startup. through this experience, i migrated a few degrees away from hands-on technical work and led the organization as a senior executive. the company recently ceased operations
