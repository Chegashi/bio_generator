penetration testing is my passion, discovering the truth about cybersecurity posture and utilizing my studies to discover situations we didn't know exist before the wrong people find those situations. i am very reality oriented, and normalcy bias plays no role in my vocation. i'm always adapting to new situations, proactively seeking the next threat vector, and staying ahead where others react and panic.  i believe in security in all its avenues. when others celebrate summer, i plan for winter. where others bury their faces in their smartphones on sidewalks, i'm alert to my surroundings. when others celebrate the bull market, i plan to survive and thrive in the bear market. i'm an optimist, not because i believe the sheer power of my positivity will chase away bad situations, but because i believe in my power to prepare for and thrive in any situation. to find out more, please message me.

environmental and threat analysis | putting threat and risk into business perspective | helping translate the latest headlines into understandable potential business impacts ||  i'm a voracious learner, an all-around analytic critical thinker, and interested in many areas of information technology, especially the advances in artificial intelligence.  i'm very aware of how critical a role information technology has come to play in the business world and how integral it has become to people in their personal lives. i am also fascinated by how advances in fields like virtual reality and artificial intelligence influence and change society and the human condition. as the influence of information technology expands, so does the importance of proper information security. protecting data and especially personal data is a daunting challenge, and i want to make it simpler to understand the risks and ramifications associated with security and properly protecting information. people have enough to deal with in their every day lives without having to try to keep up with the latest news and buzzwords on infosec and what new threats are looming on the horizon...   i go through life with a paranoid mind, so that others don't have to.
todays threat-landscape and the complexity of the ttp used to attack our computing infrastructures, requires vast and complex resources to defend against such attacks, where detection and recovery from the negative business-impact of such attacks, have been proven, if not impossible but to be extremely expensive in terms of labor and financial cost.  defending against advanced persistent threats (apt) and many other forms of malware, requires experts with knowledge and expertise in wide-range of information security domains.  in the last 20 years of my career, i have worked in different information technology and security domains, where the deep technical insight into the major computing technologies has helped me to build a strong background in understanding the nature and mechanics of the security threats we are up against.  my most recent activities include   1- secure code review following owasp guidelines, web-app vulnerability assessment (burp pro), risk assessment, and mitigation planning.   2-sqlalchemy, business logic analysis for efficiency and security gaps against owasp-top 10 list of vulnerabilities (2007-2017).  2- development of a c++ multithreaded project for a sensor simulator in a lab environment.  3- forensic evidence carving from encase image file, using tsk, and decrypting efs files simulating the suspect's raw image.  4- and  more ...

curiosity is what drives any hacker. hackers take great pride in finding things they are not supposed to find. in my case i have always been curious about how things work in this world. i think its almost an innate ability that hackers carry with them. i believe that one doesn't choose to be a hacker, it just happens when you wake up one day and realize that the entire world tries to control you in some form or the other with or without your consent and you are not ready to accept that. it's only a matter of time before you start asking questions and the answers are really hard to come by. even if they come by from others, you ask yourself how much can you really trust them  just because everyone else believes that something is right doesn't make it right. i live by that motto. i tend to verify things for myself and i think all the hackers out there live by a similar motto. for me, trust is the weakest link that exists in this world. trusting others means you assume that when others are in control they will not betray you and get the better of you. so what do hackers do  they make sure that their trust is not betrayed by keeping an eye on what others are doing.   what you see is what you get  is a phrase that almost everyone is familiar with. but if you ask a hacker, he will tell you that there is very little or no truth to that. it is like a mask that is being presented to the world while all the details are hidden behind it.
 hacking , the first thought that comes to everyone's mind is  it's illegal , isn't it  a passionate mind is suppressed by others not to be a part of it. everyone thinks about the worst side of it but no one cares of patching it. for an ethical hacker the great challenge is not to hack someone but to explain others that the way he took is not illegal. the last thing that i found in this world is that none hacker is inferior not even a newbie, if you are expert in one thing the person sitting infront of you might be expert in other.

security is and will always be a major issue with whatever you use, knowing that your data is capturable and exploited by some for their benefits is disturbing for some. also the fact that cyber attackers are coming up with new ways everyday to attack you, you are never safe.  after getting my undergraduate degree from a. p. shah institute of technology. i started to explore the field of cybersecurity. and will now pursue a master's in cybersecurity from stevens institute of technology in new jersey in the coming spring.  the only reason i chose infosec as my career field is it intrigues me to challenge myself by learning new tools and system's. to tackle attacks on a system, to make an entity even more secured by audits.   to sum up my profile in three sentences  i would say i'm -  good at developing websites, better at breaking them down, wanna make a career in infosec.  feel free to reach out, if you wanna talk about tech, infosec, or cricket.

hey there, reader! i'm currently a cyber security engineer at ernst & young. i did my undergraduate program in computer science & engineering from amrita school of engineering, india. there are many personas to me, and here are some that co-exist peacefully -  (1) the pentester  me , inherits the quality that he achieved at a very small age, right since he used to break his dad's spectacles and mom's glass vessels, only now he breaks web applications, networks & systems. being a fanboy of python, most of his automation scripts revolve around footprinting and reconnaissance. he carries immense love for vapt and is often found researching in the related areas.  (2) the programmer / software developer  me , likes to build functional and useful scripts of python. the fields of these scripts consist of  natural language processing, machine learning, web scraping, social media api, deep learning & what not! most of the scripts can be found open-sourced on github.  (3)  the web developer  me , likes to build full-stack and responsive websites. he's tired of conventional bootstrap & php - and rather prefers rapid prototyping with python frameworks - flask & django. however, even after quite some experience, he can often be found ranting about the ever-increasing number of new javascript frameworks to be learned, when asked to choose from jquery, angularjs, reactjs.  (4) the coffee lover  me , is just a persona that is induced by the above three personas, to keep away from sleep and to battle the rants of the above three personas on a day-to-day basis.  (5) the cricket maniac  me , likes playing cricket matches and analyzing variations of bowling in test cricket.  (6) the fanboy  me  likes watching & discussing many tv series', such as - la  casa de papel, game of thrones, breaking bad, silicon valley, etc.  (7) the grammar nazi  me  likes the english language in general and shalt mercilessly correct your grammar/spelling mistakes. he also likes reading novels and is in charge of writing the blog posts.
