if there is one thing that drives the many varied aspects of my career, it is the desire to build large systems with a large number of users that have a big impact. this has led me to focus on distributed computing and networking, machine learning, natural language processing, security and more. though these skills don't necessarily lend themselves to a single domain of effort, it has given me a number of perspectives that inform my designs of complex systems. largely, i am therefore an architect and programmer whose focus is a balance between human and machine intelligence. these perspectives are also taken from my career in a variety of startups and academia. i've enjoyed being a part of extremely effective small to medium sized teams building recommender systems, reading level classifiers, smart iot technologies, and streaming analytics. in academia, i've taught applied data science and machine learning at georgetown university and completed a phd at the university of maryland where i studied planetary-scale data systems. to build great software, you need a great team and as a result, i think knowledge sharing and openness is another critical pillar of my career. i've contributed to many open source projects and am the maintainer of the yellowbrick python package - a visual diagnostics tool for machine learning that is affiliated with numfocus. i've presented work at conferences including pycon and pydata. and finally

solving puzzles to help others, could there be a better job i've always loved puzzles and for me the puzzle pieces are data. i love collecting the data, sorting through and connecting the data, and finally using that data to solve a problem and make an impact. data science has given me the framework to pragmatically apply my math and science skills to puzzles in a wide range of fields. whether it's marketing models or semi-conductor research, there is data and there is the potential to use that data for overcoming obstacles. it s always been about the data. in the past i ve worked as a scientist and engineer to solve problems mostly at the lab bench, but the experiments and solutions have always been driven by data. i used data to define the problem, form a hypothesis, and design the experiments. then the data collected from the experiments was used to build a model, make predictions, and inspire future experiments. while i loved my time in the lab, i've recently decided to apply my efforts towards larger puzzles found in data science.jackiekokx,

i pursued my master s in computer science at the university of illinois urbana-champaign, where i focused on machine learning. i did my undergrad in computer science at a public university in india. during the summers, i spent my time working on projects with professors of the university and the results of one of these projects made me more interested in machine learning. after completing my undergraduate studies, i wanted to get some exposure to solving real problems using machine learning. so i joined a machine learning startup as a data analyst and then was promoted to junior data scientist. i learned a ton about the initial steps in the data science process which hugely involved data processing and cleaning. i got to automate major parts of this process and deployed it in production. i also worked a lot on doing data analysis and building predictive models. this experience showed me that i am very interested in working in a challenging environment for solving problems. currently, i am doing courses related to machine learning and working with a professor on an interesting project.kavideveloped

i have recently finished my phd in computer science in the area of computational linguistics. specifically my research focuses on constructing network based representations of text. using these representations i have been able to improve upon the state of the art in the field of unsupervised keyphrase extraction, which involves algorithms that can find the most important terms in a document without requiring any training data. i presented these results in the semeval 2015 conference on computational linguistics. most of the data analysis skills that i have acquired during my research on mining topics using network based representations of text are directly applicable to many other fields such as social network analysis, computational biology, user segmentation and recommender systems. for example my experience on finding the important terms in a graph based representation of text can be directly applied to finding highly influential users in a social or e-commerce network or to finding hub proteins in a protein interaction network. in addition to network based methods i am familiar with a variety of statistical machine learning techniques as i have listed in my skills. in addition to the experience i have gained in data analysis and algorithm development during the course of my phd i also have 7+ years of experience as a software engineer. my goal has always been to maintain a working knowledge of the full stack of web development technologies. this combined with my experience with big data tools and data analysis techniques allow me to contribute to all the stages of the mining of insight from the development of scalable data analysis algorithms to the creation of web based interactive visualisations of the extracted information. i have a passion for detecting and visualizing useful insights from raw unstructured information and i have strived to gain the set of skills that allow me to design and engineer end to end solutions.

i joined foundation capital as a general partner because i thought it would be a great opportunity to apply my lifelong learning of scaling organizations to help entrepreneurs succeed in achieving their vision. i get most excited about b2b, specifically focusing on companies that are applying machine learning/ai across the enterprise stack. like most of the partners at foundation capital, my background is as an operator. i ve spent 15 years in a variety of roles that have taught me some important lessons . i ve applied these lessons to being the type of board member who truly acts as a partner to the entrepreneurs by being a friend and supporter, but also a challenger, and through that, hopefully helping the founder to achieve their highest aspirations. one of my high points as a vc was when one of my ceos told me that he enjoys putting me in front of his entire team in all hands meetings because he felt it has a positive impact on internal motivation and in turn, the bottom line. i was so grateful to receive this kind of feedback because helping my portfolio companies succeed is my main goal as a vc. one way i realize this is through my unconditional commitment to stand by a founder s side as we work together to make their company a success throughout all of the highs and lows a startup naturally experiences. one thing that i ve learned through my operational experience is being able to really zoom in and focus on important issues that will improve a product or the overall user experience. i m not really a fade-into-the-background kind of guy. what i mean by that is i am committed to delivering constructive feedback in a respectful way if i feel it will propel growth forward, even if it can get uncomfortable at times. however, i also believe i am good at knowing when to step aside and let the entrepreneur execute.

skilled in mathematical modeling, optimization and operation research. enthusiastic about big data 1. cognitive computing to find pattern 2. machine learning 3. descriptive, predictive and prescriptive analytics 4. visualisation of big data. 5. stream analytics at the heart of deriving insight from data is the ability to view the data through a quantitative lens. there are textures, patterns, dimensions, and correlations in data that can be expressed numerically, and discovering inference from data becomes a brain teaser of mathematical techniques. solutions to many business problems often involve building analytic models that are deeply grounded in the hard math theory, and being able to understand how models work is as important as knowing the process to build them.
