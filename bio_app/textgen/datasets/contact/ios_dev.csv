I love building. 🛠🚀😎  My career so far can by divided into 3 Acts :  Act I : Computer Graphics  While at Michigan, I was drawn into the world of Computer Graphics Programming due to the pure stimulation of turning written code into a visual image. I spent 11 years in the Visual Effects / Animation Industry as a generalist, with a focus on all things rendering and shading. I loved that there was always something new to learn and several layers of depth to explore in any given topic.  Act II : iOS  Living in Santa Monica, I saw first-hand the innovation happening in Web & Mobile and wanted to be a part of it. I was lucky enough to learn iOS Development from zero while at Originate. This led to working with various early stage startups and building MVPs for clients. I was fortunate enough to be Lead iOS for Studio TIU, which was featured a few times by Apple under 'New Apps We Love' and 'App of the Day'.  Act III : Mobile + Augmented Reality  Pivoting into iOS, I knew that it was inevitable that my worlds would collide. With Augmented Reality on the brink of being a major platform shift, I have been very involved in the community and have co-founded a location-based AR startup Neon. I now see product and technology through this lens and am very excited for what the future will bring!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Curbit","VP Engineering / iOS Developer","Mar 2020","PRESENT","Contactless Curbside Pickup Platform","","https://www.linkedin.com/company/driving-thru-inc","driving-thru-inc",,,"Bird","iOS Engineer","Dec 2018","Mar 2020","Making continuous feature updates and UX improvements to the Rider Product for Bird iOS App. 📱🛴🔥💨😎","","https://www.linkedin.com/company/birdapp","birdapp",,,"Neon AR","Co-Founder / VP of Engineering","Dec 2017","Dec 2018","Built Location-Based Augmented Reality Stack for AR Social Networking Application.

I look forward to helping in any way that I can.  Five things that make me good at what I do :  1. No Fear to Fail - Allows me to push boundaries without worrying about the risk. I build faster knowing that I can get to my failures faster and overcome / fix them quicker.  2. Desire to Change - Most people love their comfort zone and hate to change. I desire things to constantly be evolving. Granted this puts way more work on my plate, but it also pushes me to better myself everyday.  3. Imagination - I embrace my childlike way of life. I love to have fun, whether it is playing video games, watching animated movies, or even day dreaming of other worlds. To push past what we know, we need to imagine things outside of the known. Mixing things together that don't make sense is done by using your imagination. I tend to come up with my best ideas after I have been acting like a kid for a couple hours.  4. Devil's Advocate - Most people love and hate me for this reason at the same time. I will practice this characteristic when I believe others are settling for something that can be better. I love asking questions to stir up answers that might not have come out if everyone agreed. I enjoy ripping ideas apart, to find why the person really is pursuing the idea. Sometimes I find out that they just are in it for the money and they didn't actually think about solving a problem.  5. Passionate - Giving up is for those who don't have a reason to keep going. Many people have succeeded against all odds, because of their passionate drive. I only work on what I am passionate about. Lastly, I am very passionate about creation and new ideas. I love helping other brainstorm and strategize how to make their idea come to life and be successful.","Joalbright",,,,,,,,,,,,,"https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/jo-albright/id579943399?mt=8","http://jo2.co","http://life.jo2.co","Roadie Inc","Senior Developer - iOS Focus","Jul 2018","PRESENT","Developing software to enable users to successfully and easily deliver their important cargo.","","https://www.linkedin.com/company/roadie-inc","roadie-inc",,,"State Farm ®","Senior Developer - iOS Focus","Jan 2016","Jun 2018","Senior iOS Developer - Worked on agent and consumer facing apps, AI and chat bots, and VR/AR exploration.","Atlanta Ga","https://www.linkedin.com/company/state_farm","state_farm",,,"BadTroll","Founder & CEO","Jan 2015","Jun 2018","Creating a new collective that will allow developers, designers, & other creatives to join forces to create / finish apps and more.","Greater Atlanta Area","https://www.linkedin.com/company/badtroll","badtroll",,,"The Iron Yard","iOS Instructor","Jan 2014","Dec 2015","Helped start up the Atlanta campus.

Since 2000, I've watched the rate at which businesses adopt emerging technologies rise, which requires us as technology leaders to keep entire workforces connected. Increased connectivity with customers and vendors must be supported by enhanced infrastructure including computers, mobile devices, cloud solutions, and media creation software.  Over the years, I've learned and practiced the critical art of building bridges between technology and people. Without people who are engaged with their hearts and minds in technology solutions, business sees little improvement. Successful implementation of technology solutions requires deep collaboration and empathy. Great business leaders listen to their people, understand their challenges, and find ways to improve technology. Successful execution also requires communication and training, which requires an understanding of how the workforce thinks and learns, reasons for why the new solution exists, and a level of teaching mastery to effectively educate workers in the use of new technology.  These are the principles and philosophies I promote as a leader in technology-driven organizations. I have a strong reputation as a technical expert, but even more so as a leader of teams. I enjoy coaching and mentoring team members as much as I enjoy managing projects.   Most recently, I was involved with a renewable energy startup. Through this experience, I migrated a few degrees away from hands-on technical work and led the organization as a senior executive. The company recently ceased operations, and I was immediately inspired by a job posting that reignited my passion for developing technology solutions. The job posting was for a Project Manager in iOS development, and I knew right away that it's a path worth pursuing - even if I have to go through a bit of retraining and education. I've been a Mac user since 2004 and completed programming bootcamps at Big Nerd Ranch (2010) and Flatiron School (2013).    I am now committing to a new path to become the best technical expert, project manager, and team leader I can become... all centered around the best technology in the world - iOS.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Teaching It Right","iOS Developer","Jul 2020","PRESENT","","Salt Lake City, Utah, United States","https://www.linkedin.com/company/teaching-it-right","teaching-it-right",,,"DevMountain Student Developers","iOS Developer | Supportly (project)","Apr 2020","Jul 2020","Swift 5 | Cloud Firestore | CocoaPods | MessageKit  * Built an iOS app that connects people with supplies to people in their community who need them * Delivered a working real-time chat (aka direct message) feature in 4 weeks * Collaborated with iOS team members and UX designers to determine MVP requirements, scope the project, and communicate feasibility of features * Developed and communicated workflow for developers to leverage GitHub to pull from develop branch, create feature branches, and then pull request from feature branch to develop branch see less","Lehi, Utah, United States","https://www.linkedin.com/company/devmountain-student-develoepr","devmountain-student-develoepr",,,"DevMountain Student Developers","Student iOS Developer","Feb 2020","Jul 2020","In March 2020, began remote learning and remote work.

Since 2013, I have been working with iOS Development. It began as a hobby but quickly developed into a beloved passion of mine. Once Apple released its first Beta of Swift back in late 2014, I was instantly hooked on it. Since then, I have been working very closely with the Swift language and its development over the years into what it is today. I have learned much about iOS and its respective SDK/frameworks and to this day, I still am extremely passionate about it and don't see that changing anytime soon.  Over the years I've been working on expanding my development knowledge, understanding other tools and stacks better.

After five years of OS X development, I crossed over to iOS where I've been ever since. Thus, not only do I have a strong background on all the legacy Foundation frameworks used in both platforms, but have prior UNIX experience with the core OS underpinnings. In addition, as a MSEE I'm quite comfortable around hardware, and built and coded a wind turbine controller a few years ago.  I also give back - see the over 1000 answers I've given on StackOverflow where I'm rated in the top 1%.

Such jobs don't currently exist, so I'm working full time on updating my pre-existing open source projects to use those new technologies.  Apple introduced Combine and SwiftUI WWDC2019, and unfortunately apps using those can't deploy to older iOS versions. However, it's very clear (to me) that Apple will drive all new iOS and MacOS development to those technologies, so no better time to master them than now!  These projects will be much more modular and easier to use:  - PhotoScrollerNetwork  Apple released PhotoScroller as a sample code project about a decade ago. Using it, an iOS app could show a really huge image that at first just fits the current view size, but could be zoomed into until you got a 1:1 pixel match. However, under the covers, you had to pre-tile the image first, then include it in your app bundle! Not good for fetching arbitrary images!  PhotoScrollerNetwork was created to address this deficiency! It uses libjpeg-turbo to incrementally reconstruct a JPEG image, one scan line at a time. These lines are written to the file system as pre-rendered bit maps at resolutions that range from ""zoomed out so complete image is visible in the current view"" to ""each image pixel matches a device pixel"".  Two UIView subclasses are provided: one to host the pre-rendered tiles in a way that makes zooming memory efficientm, and a second UIScrollView class that supports zooming in and out.  The older PhotoScrollerNetwork only supported web fetches, and frankly was not well partioned between data management and image management (i's open source!).  Soooo - I've spent the last month re-packaging it as a ""Swift Package"", and developing a new demo app using Combine and SwiftUI to put it through its paces. It's been interesting for sure!  ** more on my StackOverFlow page! ** see less","Remote","https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/all/?keywords=Open%20Source%20Initiative%20Me",,,,"Hypergiant","Senior iOS Developer - Hypergiant Space Age Solutions Division","May 2019","Dec 2019","Hypergiant Space Age Solutions Division:  Sept-Dec : Having the time of my life working on the iPad App used in conjunction with the ""EOS Bioreactor"" device, using iOS 13, Swift 5.1, and the latest Xcode:  ""Swirling Water"" - a video based view that reflects the internal state of the bioreactor. - converted a video with a black background into a HEVC format with transparency (not easy!) - added Core Image Filters (CIFilters) that change over time to the video to make it appear ""alive"" - added a spinning particle emitter behind the video to add a ""beating heart"" like effect - added particle emitters that spew diamonds and bubbles (ie: carbon and oxygen, what the reactor does)  ""Chart View"" - the view that shows detailed metrics.

From here I was instructed to outline changes that could be made to make it easier for the rest of the team to develop features.  This included building out a new services gateway (written in Node.js) to enable the client to no longer have to parse the JSONAPI that it was currently. During this transition I moved the core framework over to utilize the latest version of Alamofire to consume the new RESTful service I build in our services stack. During this time we also removed the majority of our PromiseKit dependencies from both the iOS and tvOS application.  After this process was completed, we were tasked with the complete rebrand of the application's. Initially being just a reskin of the current implementation, it actually turned into a complete overhaul. The team built out a secondary internal framework for core UI components, which allowed development on the applications a lot easier.

Hello there!   I’m an Senior iOS Developer at Quicken Loans in Detroit, with over 7 years of experience in the industry. Building native iOS applications became my passion very early on, and I still truly enjoy everything about it. Swift has really opened the doors to new developers in the iOS space, and it’s been great to have fresh perspectives come aboard. My daily tasks with Expedia include building out features, monitoring crash logs, working closely with product and design teams, mentoring teammates, and providing valuable feedback on pull requests.  Aside from being a developer, I’m also passionate about contributing to the developer community. In 2017 I began a Meetup group called LaDev. It’s since evolved, but I’ve learned so many valuable lessons leading and organizing it, it’s been such a rewarding experience. Additionally, I blog at dev.to and kimarnett.com and lead workshops and conference sessions in the Great Lakes region.  For my next position, I’m looking for either a Senior iOS Development role, or a iOS Lead type role where I can make a difference towards an inclusive environment, clean code, and shipping amazing features.

That confusion changed when I took an iOS Development course in my university. I knew exactly what I wanted to do.   After discovering my passion for iOS Development, I just couldn't get enough. I now know that my passion is creating products of my own, but also working with product owners/designers to turn ideas into reality bringing quality products to consumers/users. I have had the opportunity to create an app for PIECED, complete an iOS Development Internship with Glassdoor, released an app onto the App Store, mentored multiple students in iOS development, and there's no stopping now.

For the most part I’ve been specialised in the design and development of commercial and in-house desktop applications for Microsoft Windows though I have also worked on other platforms such as the Xbox and PlayStation.  I’ve recently made a move away from full time employment to make a fresh start as an independent mobile app developer focused on the Apple iOS platform using Xcode and Swift. I’m now using my time to immerse myself in the technology, learning, developing and eventually publishing my own apps.  For most of my 12+ years in Cambridge I worked as a senior software engineer with development skills mostly focused on using C# with .NET/WinForms/WPF/XAML/MVVM in Visual Studio. I also developed using Java with AWT/Swing in Eclipse for over 6 of those years.  I have excellent technical knowledge, analytical ability and organisational skills. I work with a high level of professionalism and commitment and take a very thorough approach to programming. My emphasis is on developing robust, quality code and applications that are easy to maintain, extend and use. I have also been comfortable with guiding colleagues in software design and implementation techniques.   In my spare time I have developed for the Windows Phone 7 mobile device for which I successfully published an app to the Windows Phone Marketplace. I have also experimented with technologies such as Xamarin, Unity, XNA and Managed DirectX out of curiosity and professional interest.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Independent","iOS Developer","avr. 2019","Aujourd’hui","With over 20 years of software engineering experience, I've now moved out of full time employment over to the indie mobile app developer life.

My primary contribution to the project aside from day-to-day development was the creation of a UI toolkit used to develop custom user interface elements in isolation from the main application codebase. This toolkit ranged from customised buttons and controls right up to bespoke containment view controllers, an API for building data collection forms, and a message presentation mechanism that could be seamlessly integrated in to any UI.  I also focussed on the core iOS platform experience, which lead to the integration of Spotlight search support for items a user had viewed in the app, and the ability to trigger searches in the app from the iOS system search screen. Application Shortcuts were another feature I added to allow users to initiate product searches or scan barcodes from the app’s icon on the home screen.  One other piece of functionality I built was a tool for measuring the area of walls and floors using ARKit to aid in the calculation of the quantity of a product needed to cover the measured surface. This involved more custom user interface work as well as interaction with SceneKit to detect and measure 2D planes from points placed by the user in 3D space. voir moins","","https://www.linkedin.com/company/kingfisher","kingfisher",,,"Ordnance Survey","iOS Developer (Contract)","mars 2016","oct. 2016","I was brought in to deliver the new Route Discovery feature for the OS Maps app successfully on a tight timescale, which allows users to find over 500,000 walking and cycling routes all over Great Britain.

I have written tests with OCUnit and XCTest, Specta/Expecta with OCMock, and network request stubbing with OHHTTPStubs.  Strong ability with Git and version control concepts.

Once logged in, clicking on a saved password will log the user into the website seamlessly and securely, significantly reducing login times.

Throughout my year here I was completing these projects on my own with no previous experience of Objective C.  “Claimback” is a CocoaTouch application which aids commuters in claiming back money from ScotRail if their train has been delayed or cancelled, and has recently been released on the AppStore. The customer is asked to enter details about their journey (Ticket type, Destination etc) and these details are merged into a generic email, pushed to a server and sent to ScotRail for review. Claimback uses quite a few complex technologies such as CoreData for saving previously sent claims, Location Services to pin point where the user is and how far away nearby stations are from them, ABAddressBook to access, import and populate text fields from the user’s Contacts, and PHP for communicating with our server and the sending of the claim. The iOS 6 version was fully completed within 5 months, I then moved on and completed the iOS 7 version in a further 1 month. Claimback was released on the App Store in March 2014. See attached link.  “CallMaster” is a small standalone device which connects to your phoneline and identifies CallerID information before the phone rings. The device broadcasts the Caller ID data on your local ethernet network so that mobile clients can display it on screen via alerts. The CallMaster application allows you to view a list of recent calls (blocked and not) along with the exact time and date, store names to identify regular callers, define 'quiet times' to stop the phone from ringing, and flag unwanted calls, so that the device can refuse them before the phone even rings. Technologies such as Core Animation are used and protocols such as UDP and TCP commands are also used to send data to and receive data from the hardware device. … voir plus","Glasgow, United Kingdom","https://www.linkedin.com/company/emobix-limited","emobix-limited",,,"QA Apprenticeships","Modern Apprenticeship","Computer Software Engineering","Pass","2013","2014","Joined Emobix Ltd and started my career in iOS development.

Early in my tenure, I was the only iOS developer, taking over projects that I had only recently been introduced to and quickly fixing bugs and adding new features. When more developers joined, I facilitated monthly iOS catchups for our iOS team, and began to teach other team members the platform.  Prior to joining, I had acquired a ticket to WWDC19, and attended during my time at Pocketworks. The conference gave me great insight to what's next for iOS. I spent time with the app review time and apples designers, whilst also attending labs to debug the latest beta technologies like SwiftUI.  Always looking to improve my own standards, and those of the team around me, I improved the developer guidelines for our team and began to implement automated linking for pull requests.  I interviewed developers that would join the team, looking after them from the very start, conducting coding tests and face to face interviews, before making my recommendation to the business. I did this for multiple iOS engineers and one web.  I developed a large update for the white label taxi apps that are part of a platform that facilitates over 6 million mobile bookings a year, and architected a refactor to the codebase. This was alongside working on PocketMEDIA, looking to improve some of its older code and finalising the Swift migration. Whilst working on the white label apps a new developer joined that looked after PocketMEDIA, and I managed their code reviews, giving technical direction where needed.

I have always been a believer in the hands on approach so I was involved in some of the software development as well as handling projects cycles and specifications for new development. Initially our products were written in a combination of Clipper 5.0 and C++ but it was clear that Windows was the way forward so after researching all current Windows development tools we decided to move forward using Delphi 3.0. Likewise, the Nippondenso had it’s limitations so we began replacing our handhelds with Psion Workabouts which were cheaper and more robust. By the new millennium my department had grown to seven plus contractors. Working closely with my development team I kept a handle on all current project work and worked hard at keeping Innovise as the leader in Performance Monitoring by keeping abreast of new technology without exceeding our budgets. In doing so, we had upgraded our Delphi development software through Delphi 5.0 to Delphi 7.0, which had additional capability for Web development. Our Psions were also becoming outdated and were replaced by Palm units with touch screen technology and eventually HTC phones with Windows CE. … voir plus","Brentwood","https://www.linkedin.com/company/innovise","innovise",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"""iOS Development : 4, Android : 3, Mobile Applications : 3, CRM : 3, Agile Methodologies : 3, Project Management : 2, Web Development : 2, Software Development : 2, C# : 3, ASP.NET MVC : 2, Microsoft SQL Server : 1, jQuery : 1, .NET Framework : 1, VB.NET : 0, Management : 3, MVC : 1, ""","",10,,"Logiciels informatiques",,,,,"xDesign; VMCloud Ltd; Dyson; BSAVA (British Small Animal Veterinary Association); iOS & Android Specialists; DD"

We’re aiming to be the UK’s best digital business, constantly innovating and with the mission to ensure players understand the potential risks associated with gambling, the rules around betting integrity, and know how to look out for signs of potential harm in their gaming.  My career in the mobile development industry started late; during my studies I worked a lot as systems integrator for small businesses and as C/C++ developer in many minor projects, which introduced me to the world of software development. I wasn't new to embedded platforms at the time but smartphones never got me as much as Robotics or GPU development, until I did my internship with the S.I.A. in Palermo. During my period as an intern, I developed a prototype for a modular and responsive native Android app which laid the foundation of the official UniPa app.  After almost a year as a freelance Android Developer, I was hired by MangoADV, which was in search of an iOS Developer. I didn't found any major issue in switching my main working platform and environment, I thought it was instead a stimulant opportunity to push further my career. I learned Objective-C, Swift, Protocol Oriented Programming and I also developed many apps plus a SDK for mobile in-app advertising. That year as an iOS Developer engaged me so much that I put myself in play again, so I joined the first ever European Developer Academy founded and run by Apple Inc. in Naples, where I learned how to embrace an Agile environment and how modern companies work on ideas while bringing them to life.   My aim is now to become a wiser and better developer: project after project, solution after solution. I still work on what made me love the world of computers since I was a child (computer graphics and game development), but for the time being I am having a great time with mobile platforms so I think I'll save those skills for the next big shift in my career!","AndrosTMM",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Sky Betting & Gaming","iOS Software Engineer","nov. 2019","Aujourd’hui","We're a tech company born out of Sky.

Lunar features can be searched and selected. This application makes much greater use of the iPhone APIs than the game. Atlases are also available for Mars, Mercury and Venus plus a star charting app called Planisphere. I built iPad versions of my apps Moon Atlas, Mars Atlas and Planisphere for the launch of the iPad.

Communication with an existing .NET XML/SOAP based web service was necessary using a combination of hard coded HTTP requests and a third party code generation tool. This converted the WSDL data contract into native Objective-C classes which could be serialised to XML.

A startup with its innovative and award winning ideas, and a creative agency curating apps to break the mould.   As a hobby I am currently maintaining an app called Podcast Alarm, which allows users to wake up inspired with their favourite podcasts. It's a profitable project that is enjoyed by hundreds of paying customers (PodcastAlarm.app). I have made and released other apps in the past, most notably, Gifable (Gifableapp.com) which has had thousands of downloads since I released it in October 2017. I enjoy working on my own projects which further develop my skills and plan to release more of my work throughout 2020.","JohnyJWilson",,,,,,,,,,,,,"http://gifableapp.com","http://podcastalarm.app",,"ShopKeep","Senior iOS Software Developer","déc. 2018","Aujourd’hui","","Belfast, United Kingdom","https://www.linkedin.com/company/shopkeep-pos","shopkeep-pos",,,"ShopKeep","iOS Software Developer","avr. 2017","Aujourd’hui","At Shopkeep I work with a large team of iOS developers on a complex application that provides a point of sale solution for thousands of shops in the USA.

During my time I this role, I was given the opportunity to develop my own creation that helped to automate some of the elements to creating metadata for clients. This initial version was rolled out across the company for other Account Managers to use too.  After being at the company for a few months, I progressed to become a Paid Search Executive. This was similar to my previous Account Manager role but with a greater focus on managing Apple Search Ads campaigns - something I had prior experience with from running them for my own apps. In this new role, I was given the opportunity to visit Apple’s London office to become one of the first 15 in Europe to be officially certified for managing Apple Search Ads campaigns.  Over time, more features were added to the Redbox Toolbox application that meant I was able to transition to a full time development role within the company. Although the sole developer of the Toolbox, I feed into a wider development team who primarily work on the Blackbox Platform.  The Redbox Toolbox application was initially just offered as an internal application within the company to help streamline ASO operations.

Reroo is a mobile app to help train travellers save up to 55% on long-distance train tickets. (Yes, even on last-minute tickets). How do we do this wizardry? Re-routing; we find alternative indirect routes to show you the cheapest options available, as well as the most direct and fastest routes.  - Why have we started Reroo? As students we were super-frustrated with forking out a small fortune to go visit family and friends in different cities in the UK. In an ideal world, we’d book tickets months in advance, but that’s almost never realistic. There must be a cheap and convenient way to get to your destination. Coaches are cheaper than trains, but long and uncomfortable. But what if there was a way to get trains that are cheap, but not as long as coaches? That would be a win-win.  - When can you try it?  Download it now on: iOS - https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/reroo/id1026253424?mt=8 Android - https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.reroo  - Are you regulated as a train ticket vendor? We’re getting there. We’re in the process of getting accredited to be a third party retailer to sell train tickets from our app.  - Stay in touch You can sign up for email updates at reroo.co.uk chat with us on Twitter at @rerooapp Hit us up with feedback, questions, concerns, requests or anything else email us on hello@reroo.co.uk voir moins","London, United Kingdom","https://www.linkedin.com/company/reroo-ltd","reroo-ltd",,,"The AA","iOS Developer","août 2017","août 2018","At the AA I worked on various different aspects of their mobile app, including improving the user experience of how users report a breakdown, and improving the performance of how users access their member benefits.
